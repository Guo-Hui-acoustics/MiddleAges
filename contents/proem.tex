\lettrine{I}{t} is the 41st Millennium. 
For more than a hundred centuries, 
the Emperor has sat immobile on the Golden Throne of Earth. 
He is the Master of Mankind by the will of the gods, 
and master of a million worlds by the might of his inexhaustible armies.

I, \textbf{Historitor Guo}, 
have been charged by the Lord Commander himself to compile this record. 
To look back into the abyss of time is to invite madness, 
yet we must understand where we came from to know why we fight.

This chronicle is not merely history; 
it is a warning. 
It details the rise of the Ruinous Powers, 
the treachery of the Arch-Traitor, 
and the eternal vigil we must keep.
