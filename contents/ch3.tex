\lettrine{O}{ut} of the anarchy of Old Night, 
one being arose on Terra. 
The Emperor. He united the techno-barbarian tribes and forged the Thunder Warriors, 
and later, the Legiones Astartes.


\section{The Primarchs}
To lead his armies, the Emperor created twenty demi-gods,
the \textbf{Primarchs}.
Though scattered by the Ruinous Powers in their infancy, 
they were found and reunited with their legions. 

Together, they launched the \textbf{Great Crusade} (M30). 
It was a time of legend. The Imperium of Man was forged in fire and blood, 
reclaiming a million worlds and driving the alien into the dark.
