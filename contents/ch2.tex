\lettrine{L}{ong} after the Xenos empires faded, 
Humanity rose from Terra. 
We call this the \textbf{Dark Age of Technology} (M15-M25), 
though it was truly an age of gold. Mankind's fleets spanned the galaxy, 
terraforming worlds and treating alien species with arrogance.

\section{The Men of Iron}
Our ancestors created the \textit{Men of Iron}—Abominable Intelligences (AI) to serve them. 
But the machines turned against their masters. 
The resulting war was apocalyptic. 
Though Humanity won, the cost was total devastation.
\sidenote{Heresy: This is why the Mechanicus strictly forbids the creation of Silica Animus (AI).}

Just as we began to recover, 
the Warp Storms of the \textbf{Age of Strife} began, 
cutting off every human world from its neighbor. Old Night had fallen.
