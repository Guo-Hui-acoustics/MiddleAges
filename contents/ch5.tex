\lettrine{N}{ow}, the galaxy is split in two by the Great Rift (Cicatrix Maledictum). 
The light of the Astronomican is dim. But hope returns. 
The Primarch Roboute Guilliman has risen from stasis.

The \textbf{Indomitus Crusade} has been launched to reclaim what was lost. 
The Primaris Space Marines have joined the fray. 
The war continues, as it must, for in the grim darkness of the far future, there is only war.
